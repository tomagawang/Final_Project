# Final_Project
This is a solo project.

Interactive story

This project is a python interactive story based on a script that I have written in the past. There are mini negotiation games, math calculations, sentiment analysis built into the story. Users will need to make tough decisions while they are playing the story and their decisions will affect the storyline. I may not be able to present the full 3 act due to the length of the story, but this project will at least include act 1 and part of act 2. 

Logline:

Despite his family burdens, a successful businessman struggles to quit his job as the board tempts him with eye-watering benefits.
